# ShootingRange
API App

The subject of the work was to design a web application, the purpose of which was to facilitate
the operation of the shooting range, to reduce paper documentation and to reduce the
number of human errors. This was done by implementing functionalities such as ammunition
and firearms management, registering the customers, keeping the register of stay in the facility,
controlling orders placed and summarizing them. The application also enables ongoing
supervision over spots and consumers.
